# Messenger-Clone
This is a real-time messenger clone.

Frontend Development: I leveraged React as the primary library to create the user interface. 

Framework: Next.js 13 as the development framework. 

Authentication: Using React for authentication mechanisms ensured that only authorized users could access the platform and their respective chat rooms.

Database: The robust combination of Prisma as an ORM and MongoDB as the database was implemented. 

Styling: Tailwind CSS for styling the application.

Real-time Communication: To ensure real-time communication, Pusher was itergated.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
